nodemud runs under node.  It's set up to work with heroku out of the box for free hosting.  
Here's the instructions for getting that to work:

Prerequisites

Basic Node.js knowledge, including an installed version of Node.js and NPM.
Your application must run on Node.js 0.4.7.
Your application must use NPM to manage dependencies.
A Heroku user account. Signup is free and instant.

Next the heroku command line must be installed.
Linux users: http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/linux/readme
OSX: http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/osx/download
Windows: http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/windows/download

Once installed, youâ€™ll have access to the heroku command from your command shell. Log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Heroku account:

```
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: adam@example.com
Password: 
Could not find an existing public key.
Would you like to generate one? [Yn] 
Generating new SSH public key.
Uploading ssh public key /Users/adam/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Once you have heroku commandline you can create your app

```
heroku create name_of_project
```

Now you simply need to push a git repo.  If you already have a repo you can skip this set. Otherwise set it up:

```
git init
git add .
git push heroku master
```

As the final step you need to allocate a dyno for the game to run on:

```
heroku ps:scale web:1
```

You can check that this worked with:

```
heroku ps
```


The game will boot up and name_of_project.heroku.com is the address.
If there's a problem try heroku logs to see what is keeping it from booting. 


Caveats:
Heroku won't allow the app to stay up unless it binds to port 80 within 60 seconds.  So no matter what, the minimal web server included must stay in place to use heroku as a platform.
